You can try any Git/GitHub feature (such as pull requests) on this repo.

1. What is Git?
    - Git is a version control system, designed to handle everything related to source code management
    - Git is used to track changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together
2. Creating a GitHub account
    - Go to: https://github.com/signup
    - Fill in all the required fields
3. GitHub repositories
    - A repository contains all the files of your project, and each revision of it
    - A repository may also contain multiple branches and will usually have multiple contributors
4. Repository branches
    - Branches allow contributors to develop features, fix bugs or experiment new ides in a contained area of the repository
    - A branch can be created from an existing branch, typically new branches are created from the default branch of the repository
5. Merging branches
    - Merging takes the contents of a source branch and integrates them with the target branch. In this process, only the target branch is changed. The source branch history remains the same
6. Pull requests
    - A pull request is an event that takes place when a contributor is ready to begin the process of merging new code changes with the main project branch. After a peer review, the pull request will be approved or not. If it is approved, then it can be merged with the main project branch. If not, the author must make the requested changes and so on.
